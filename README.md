<h3> ❔ &nbsp;Who am I  ❔</h3>
<p align="left">My name is Paul Hall but most call me PJ. I have studied IT/Computer Science since I was 11 but have had
an interest in the field for as long as i can remember. Over my learning process i have produced, applications, websites and small games each with the intent to develop my skills further. I am looking into a career in software development and I am seeking a junior/entry-level role.<br>I began my journey with software in secondary school where i was introduced to programming properly for the first time and have been coding in some regard ever since.</p>
