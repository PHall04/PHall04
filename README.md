<h2> ❔ &nbsp;Who am I  ❔</h2>
<p align="left">My name is Paul Hall but most call me PJ. I have studied IT/Computer Science since I was 11 but have had
an interest in the field for as long as i can remember. Over my learning process i have produced, applications, websites and small games each with the intent to develop my skills further. I am looking into a career in software development and I am seeking a junior/entry-level role.<br>I began my journey with software in secondary school where i was introduced to programming properly for the first time and have been coding in some regard ever since.</p>
<h3> 📚 &nbsp;What have I learned?  📚</h3>
<p align="left">My most recent educational history is with JustIT where I graduated a 12 week, intensive software development bootcamp. During this time I developed my skills related to:<br>HTML<br>CSS<br>Javascript<br>MySQL<br>C#</p>
<p align="left">Prior to this bootcamp I had attained A-levels in both Computing and Media as well as 9 GCSEs.</p>

<h3> 📚 &nbsp;What am I learning next?  📚</h3>
<p>While seeking employment I have decided to teach myself how to use Monogame in C# to develop games using a base engine that is configurable. I hope this project will improve my understanding C# development as it will require a higher level of planning as well as necssitating the use of more complex C# code.
Outside of C# I am currently looking into Python and in particular Tensorflow as having the basic understanding of the language combined with knowledge of implementing AI APIS is enormously beneficial in a world ever impacted by newer AI models.</p>
<h3>💬 &nbsp;Ask me about?  💬</h3>
  <p>I have lifelong interests in: Videogames, Alt/Indie Music, Gardening and Neurodiverse Awareness, feel free to ask me about them. I could talk endlessly about any of these !</p>
